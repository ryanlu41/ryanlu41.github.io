This is a quick but tasty recipe I use whenever I don't feel like putting effort into cooking. I list bell peppers in the recipe, but they can be replaced by any vegetable(s) of your choice basically.

### Ingredients

* 1 serving noodles (I prefer wider noodles)
* 2 skinless and boneless chicken thighs
* 1 bell pepper
* 1/2 onion
* 8 cloves of garlic
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup oyster sauce
* 1/4 cup water
* 1/8 cup rice wine
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp sugar
* chile flakes (I use gochugaru)
* salt
* pepper
* olive oil

### Directions

1. Cut the chicken thighs into small, bite size pieces. Chop onions and bell peppers. Dice the garlic.
2. Mix soy sauce, oyster sauce, water, rice wine, sesame oil, sugar, chile flakes, and diced garlic together to make the sauce. Set aside.
3. Cook noodles and set aside.
4. Heat oil in a pan on high heat, and add chicken thighs. Season with salt and papper, and stir fry for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked. Remove the chicken.
4. In the same pan, add the chopped onions and bell peppers. Cook for 5 minutes on medium heat.
5. Set the heat to low, and add chicken thighs and noodles into the pan. Pour sauce into the pan and mix thoroughly. Leave on low heat for 1 minute.
