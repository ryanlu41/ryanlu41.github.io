__"You don't have to be a terrible person to intentionally try to change the time line. You just have to have a moment of weakness. Really just a moment. When I *weakness*, I might mean something more like *humanity*."__

What can be said to be a weakness in time travelers cannot be said of Emily St. John Mandel's **Sea of Tranquility**. The novel is bursting at the seams with humanity, and it is one of the best books I have read recently.
