Dumplings are one of my favorite foods to cook. They're delicious and super fun to make, especially with other people. This is less of a recipe, and more of a rough outline on how to make the type dumplings my family usually makes. As a result, I left some of the ingredient quantities blank, since they can be easily adjusted based on personal preference. In the future, I might replace these with more exact quantities, but I am currently very approximate with them.


### Ingredients

* 1 pound ground pork
* 1 pound shrimp
* chives
* Chinese cabbage
* dumpling wrappers
* ginger
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* salt
* pepper
* sugar
* 1 egg
* chicken broth

### Directions
1. Peel and devein shrimp, then dice into small pieces
2. Dice the chives and cabbage, add salt, and let sit for a few minutes. 
3. Mix ground pork, shrimp, minced ginger, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, pepper, and egg in a large bowl.
4. Add 2 tbsp of chicken broth into the bowl and stir. Keep adding and stirring 2 tbsp at a time until the meat is a bit loose.
5. Squeeze the water from the chives and cabbage and mix into the meat. 
6. Taste the filling by microwaving a small spoonful of the meat. Add salt and adjust other sauces if necessary.
7. Wrap the dumplings. 
8. To make boiled dumplings, add dumplings to boiling water. Once the water boils again, add 1 cup of cold water. Repeat a second time, and once the water boils the third time after adding the dumplings, the dumplings are ready. Note: You can easily freeze these dumplings and make them later. Just add another boil cycle if you're cooking frozen dumplings.
