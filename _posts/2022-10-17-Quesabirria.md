1. Add meat, onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaves, and peppers into a pot and cover with hot water. Add chicken boullion, oregano, cumin, salt, and boil.
2. Scoop impurities off the top of the pot after 30 minutes with a spoon.
3. Remove chipotle peppers and blend with 1/4 cup of broth. Add peppers back into broth along with chili powder.
