In 1848, 150 years before my Chinese immigrant parents arrived in the United States, a carpenter named James Marshall was helping build a sawmill on the American River in Northern California. The tale goes that on the morning of January 24th, he noticed a shiny glimmer along the river bed. That glimmer turned out to be a piece of gold, and his discovery triggered the California Gold Rush of 1849. The historical site of that mill is now the Marshall Gold Discovery Historic Park in the town of Coloma, which is only a 30 minute drive from Folsom, the town I grew up in.

Mankind's fascination for gold long predates the 1848 Gold Rush. By 4000 BCE, gold was already being used decoratively, and it was first used for coinage around 550 BCE. But why has gold captured the human imagination for so long? Obviously, it is rare and beautiful--but so are some other metals such as silver. However, unlike silver, copper, or iron, which tarnish, corrode, or rust, gold is chemically innert; its beauty persists, making it a brilliant (pun-intended) choice for jewelry and coins. 

---

As the news of that bewitchingly beautiful gold spread, people from around the US and the world converged onto California in one of the largest human migrations in American history. Notably, the Gold Rush led to the first major wave of Chinese immigrants to the US, and over 300,000 Chinese people made their way to the West Coast by 1882. One of the Chinese names for San Francisco to this day is 旧金山 (Jiùjīnshān)--"Old Gold Mountain."

The sacrifices made by these Chinese immigrants were unnumerable. Most immigrants were men, and although more than half were married, very few came with their wives and families. Many were never reunited with their loved ones. A Chinese folk song at the time goes:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
*In the second reign year of Haamfung\*, a trip to Gold Mountain was made. <br>
With a pillow on my shoulder, I began my perilous journey. <br>
Sailing a boat with bamboo poles across the seas, <br>
Leaving behind wife and sisters in search of money, <br>
No longer lingering with the woman in the bedroom, <br>
No longer paying respect to parents at home.*
{: refdef}
\* aka the Xianfeng Emperor, year 1852

Chinese immigrants also faced intense racial discrimination. Laws such as the Foreign Miners' Tax specifically targeted Chinese miners. In 1871, 18 Chinese men were lynched in Los Angeles during the Chinese Massacre of 1871. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act ended Chinese Immigration and prevented immigrants already in the country from becoming citizens. These restrictions were not fully lifted until 1965, and in 1998, my parents were two of nearly 50,000 Chinese newcomers to the US that year. 

The contributions the first wave of Chinese immigrants made to American society are innumerable, but most famously, 14,000 Chinese workers were hired to help build the first Transcontinental Railroad.

The railroad was first proposed in 1845 by Asa Whitney in response to America's westward expansion. The project did not begin in earnest, however, until 1861 when President Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act. The Central Pacific Railroad Company built the line eastward starting from Sacramento, while the Union Pacific Rail Company laid tracks westward starting from Council Bluffs, Iowa, a town on the Missouri River. While the Union Pacific mostly hired Irish immigrants and Civil War veterans, around 80% of the Central Pacific Workers were Chinese. Many paid a heavy price for their efforts. No official records exist on the death toll of working on the railroad. However, at the time, the remains of Chinese immigrants were returned to China in accordance to traditional beliefs about the burial of bodies in one's home village. 20,000 pounds of bones were shipped back to China during the construction of the railroad--an estimated toll of 1,200 workers. Thanks for the sacrifice and hard work of these Chinese laborers, the transcontinental railroad was finally completed in May of 1869.

In the present day, rail travel has declined massively as most travelers opt for cars or planes. Nevertheless, the Amtrak still had 22.9 million riders in 2022. One of their most famous lines is called the California Zephyr. Operating between Chicago and San Francisco, the train still follows the route of the original Transcontinental Railroad for parts of the journey. In April 2023, my friend Danny and I took the 50 hour trip on the California Zephyr from my home in Chicago to my parents' home in Folsom, California.

We boarded the train around 1 pm at Union Station in downtown Chicago (as an aside, I recently learned that train stations historically owned by several companies were named union stations, hence the multitude of "Union Stations" in cities across the United States). As part of our ticket, we had access to the Amtrak Lounge and its complimentary snacks while we waited for our train to board.

Danny and I booked a roommette, so after boarding the train, we settled into the small room that would be our home for the duration of the trip. The room had two large seats that faced each other. At night, the seats reclined down towards each other into a bed. A second bed was folded open from above. We had access to public bathrooms and showers in our car. Shortly after being seated, Jake, our attendant, introduced himself to us, and soon after, another attendant from the dining car came to take our dinner order.

Our ticket included three meals a day. While the timings for breakfast and lunch were flexible, dinners needed to be reserved in advance. The food was surprisingly good. The dinners were three courses and included one alcoholic drink. The first night, I got coconut crushed shrimp, a flat iron steak, a cheesecake, and a glass of Chardonnay. Other entree options included chicken breast and steak, but I'll admit that Danny and I got the steak both nights.

The breakfast was also solid and included options such as omelets, breakfast quesadillas, and french toast. The lunch was a bit more lackluster, and I tried their average tasting grilled sandwich and beef burger during my couple lunches onboard.

Because seating was limited in the dining car, two separate parties of two were often put together at a single four-person table. By chance, Danny and I spent several meals with the same retired couple from Newcastle, England, so we had ample time to chat with them over the course of the trip. Ronnie and James, the couple in question, were delightful and interesting people. James was the husband. He had a PhD in chemistry and worked at a pharmaceutical company before retiring. His greeting towards us--"Good day boys"--was remarkable consistent and endearing. I enjoyed chatting with him about science, politics, and (European) football.

Ronnie was the wife. She referenced her career occasionally, but she preferred regaling us with stories related to her volunteering/charitable work, which was clearly much more important to her. Over dinner while passing through the Utah desert, she described her first trip to the United States with a foster child. On a whim, they decided to drive into the barren landscape of Death Valley, the memories of its magnificance evoked by a similarly stunning landscape outside the dining car window. She also told us about a boy--now an adult--who escaped Sudan during its civil war and was taken up for by her and other members of her church. Separated from his siblings and mother, he struggled a lot adapting to live in Britain. Ronnie's story had a happy ending. Although for many years, the boy had completely lost contact with his family, he recently reconnected with his mother, who had survived the horrific violence of the war and its aftermath. The story left off with his current attempts to bring her to the UK.

What a cool couple! I admit, I was initially unenthusiastic about sharing dining tables with random people. However, I feel fortunate to have crossed paths with people such as Ronnie and James, even if only for a few meals.

While not sleeping or eating, I spent almost the entire trip in the lounge car, which has tables and giant windows that wrap up onto the ceiling. I was studying (read: cramming) for STEP 1, a board exam for medical students, so I was watching videos and doing flash cards all day. Nevertheless, I tried to look up and appreciate the breath-taking scenary outside the large windows. The views were incredibly varied across the trip; the train passed through the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, the desert plateaus of Utah, the Sierra Nevadas, before descending into the Central Valley of California. Below is a small sample of the views I had--definitely not the worst place to be studying for an exam!

The thing about sight-seeing from an Amtrak train is that the panoramas fly by pretty quickly. We passed through towns in what felt like an instant. Most stops were less than five minutes, excluding major cities such as Salt Lake City or Denver. The landscape ceaselessly and rapidly rolled by; the mountains we saw in the distance enlarged until they were all around us before swiftly fading back into the distance behind us. The conductor occasionally used the intercom to highlight points of interest, especially when we were in the Rocky Mountains, but if we blinked or were too slow to the window, we missed them. 

I think the ever-changing views outside the train windows reflected the feelings inside of me. At the time, I was going through major life transitions and personal struggles, so I was inundated with a profound sense of loss. Less than a year before the trip, in June 2022, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. After months of chemotherapy, she was scheduled for surgery a few weeks after my arrival to remove the tumors in her stomach and liver. I was taking the train to spend the next six months at my parents' home to help with her recovery. The grief I felt for my mother's health was overwhelming. Life felt so short; she wasn't even 50 years old yet when we first found out, and I despaired at the uncertainty of the time left we had together. My grief for my family was compounded a few months after my mom's initial diagnosis when my maternal grandmother passed away after falling down the stairs. For many months after that June, I was severely depressed. It took everything I had to drag myself out of bed every day. Fortunately, by the time I was sitting in the lounge car, my depression was not as debilitating, thanks to my friends, my therapist, and my psychiatrist. Nevertheless, I experienced a constant sadness for my family and for the lost months consumed by depression. 

My feelings towards going home were complicated. Unlike the boy from Sudan and the immigrants form China, I was going to my parent's home, not leaving it. However, this was not going to be one of my usual 1-2 weeks trip back to Folsom. Much of my life--my friends, my new home, my career, and even my newly adopted cat--were in Chicago and leaving that behind for 6 months was a big change and a bit sad. Selfishly, I was also apprehensive about having to face the reality of my mom's illness every single day; in Chicago, I could at times find ways to distract myself and forget for a little bit. Nevertheless, I would never have not gone back to Folsom. My time with my mother was precious, and I intended to take every opportunity to be with her. If she and my father hadn't insisted otherwise, I would have taken a leave of absence during my second year of medical school to be with them in California instead of in Chicago. 

Other changes were also taking place in my life. I am in an MD/PhD program, which has a 2-4-2 structure--two years of medical school, four years of graduate school for my PhD, and finally two more years of medical school. I had just finished my second year of medical school a month before the trip, which signified the fork in the road for my medical school friends and me. Many of them are not in the MD/PhD program with me, so they were continuing with their third year of medical school while I left to do my PhD. While they were still going to be around, it still represented a marked change; their schedules would be much busier with clerkships, and I would not have the opportunity to see many of them spontaneously at school. Additionally, I was acutely aware that the past two years had flown by, and in just two more short years, many of them would leave Chicago for good for residency. I was also uneasy about actually starting my PhD. I felt unsure about whether this four year long detour from medicine was what I truly wanted to do. A younger version of myself set me on this path three years prior when he applied to MD/PhD programs in 202, but after the life-shattering events of the past year, I no longer felt like I was the same person as before.

While trying to manage all of these feelings on the train amid my board exam studying, I was reminded of a quote from the Japanese classic *The Tale of the Heinke* (full disclosure, I've never actually read this book, I learned about this quote from the manga *Jujutsu Kaisen*):

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
*The sound of the Gion Shoja temple bells echoes the impermanence of all things; the color of the sala flowers reveals the truth that to flourish is to fall. The proud do not endure, like a passing dream on a night in spring; the mighty fall at last, to be no more than dust before the wind.*
{: refdef}

The quote reflects the Buddhist belief in the constantness of change. Indeed, as I watched the scenery change rapidly around me, I felt the enormous heaviness of all the uncontrollable changes in my life.

Now, at this point, you might have some practical questions about the actual train trip, so I'll answer a few here.

**Q:** Do you have time at the train stops to get off the train and explore?

**A:** Not really. Most of the stops are extremely brief, and you're not allowed to get off the train. A few stops are around 10 minutes, so you're permitted disembark the train but highly discouraged from leaving the platform. The two stops at major cities, i.e. Denver and Salt Lake City, were around an hour. Danny and I didn't get off at Salt Lake City because the train arrived there at around 1 am. However, at Denver, we got off and visited a Whole Foods a block away from the station to pick up some sandles to use in the shower. The hour isn't really enough to do much, especially since the threat of the training leaving without you makes even short excursions a bit stressful.

**Q:** Was sleeping in the roommette comfortable?

**A:** I thought it was comfortable enough. I was in the top bunk, and our room was on the second floor of the train, so I was noticeably swaying when I was in bed. The top bunk comes with a strap to stop you from rolling off. The ceiling is a bit low, but I only hit my head once.

**Q:** How much luggage space do you get?

On Amtrak's website, the roommette is described to have space for 1-2 suitcases, and in reality, the luggage space in the room is quite limited. Danny and I could only fit my backpack and his duffel bag in the space underneath the seats. However, there are common areas for putting larger pieces of luggage, so I was able to bring 2 large suitcases with me (although one of them was *officially* Danny's).

**Q:** How was showering on the train? Did you even shower?

**A:** Yes, I showered once while on the train. After dinner the second night, I decided to grab the towels and toiletries provided by Amtrak and head downstairs to one of the showers. The door was locked, so I settled in near a window and peered outside while I waited. I was joined shortly by a woman about my age named Rebecca who also wanted to shower, and we started chatting to kill time.

Rebecca and her fiancé Peter were staying in the roommette directly across the hall from mine, although I had not spoken to either of them before this. Rebecca was a librarian at a university in Boston, and she and Peter were taking to train to see her in-laws in California. Rebecca and Peter loved animals, and amazingly, they researched all the wildlife that lived along the train route and spent their trip trying to spot as many as possible from their roommette. I was stunned by all the animals they were able to see; I didn't think that was possible given the speed of the train!

After nearly 45 minutes of talking and waiting, Jake--the attendant for our car--announced on the intercom that the hot water in our car was broken and that we should go to another car if we wanted to shower. I suspect this is why the shower was locked; I assumed at the time that someone was using it but an hour-long shower seems a bit unlikely. At any rate, Rebecca and I quickly made our way to the next car over and took our long-awaited showers. The stall was a bit cramped and the water pressure wasn't the greatest, but the water was hot and I was provided with an abundance of toiletries. Definitely not the worst showering experience.

Eight months have now passed since my trip on the California Zephyr. I'm actually writing this paragraph on New Years Eve of 2023. As I reflect on that 50 hour journey, I am struck by how deeply personal yet universal so many of our struggles are. I cannot say for certain exactly how those people felt, but I'm sure that some of the same feelings I was experiencing on the train were also experienced by my immigrant parents, the Chinese soon-to-be-miners during the Gold Rush, the Sudanese boy, and innumerable other people as they too transited from one place--and one stage of their life--to another. Although my exact circumstances are different, I feel like I can relate a little bit to the grief and loss that all these people must have felt. I think about the sacrifices so many have made for the people they love. These thoughts gives me some solace; so many people have suffered just as my family has, and overcoming this suffering is possible, just as so many have before us.

Something else that the train reminded me was to relish the present moment, since that amazing views out the window will quickly change, just as life seems to flash by sometimes. However, there is still value in those mercurial and transient moments. In the quote from *The Tale of Heike*, I often focused on the fall and the impermanence. But the quote also reminds us that in the time before that fall, there is pride, beauty, and flourishment. Something does not need to persist, like gold, to be beautiful or valuable. Sometimes beauty is a silver locket, a blossoming sala flower, a fleeting view of a mountain, a short six months with family, or a forty-five minute conversation outside an Amtrak shower with a stranger who you will never meet again.

<br>

I give the California Zephyr a 5/5. Would highly recommend.
