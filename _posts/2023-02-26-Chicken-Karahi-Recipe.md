This has been one of my favorite recipes to make recently, especially on busy weekday nights. Even though the dish is incredibly flavorful, it only takes around 30 minutes to prepare, and the ingredients are pretty basic. The recipe below is based on [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/4PMmH2-5wJM). Be sure to go check it out!

### Ingredients

* 2 lbs boneless and skinless chicken thighs
* 5 cloves of garlic
* ginger
* 1 can of whole peeled tomatoes
* salt
* black pepper
* cumin
* ground coriander
* chili powder
* tumeric
* garam masala
* MSG
* fresh cilantro
* cooking oil

### Directions

1. Dice the garlic and around a tablespoon of fresh ginger.
2. Cut the chicken thighs into ~ 1 inch cubes. Stir fry with cooking oil and a dash of salt in a wok on high heat until chicken has started to brown.
3. Add the tomatoes, diced garlic, and diced ginger. Stir and cook on medium heat until the tomatoes break down into a sauce.
4. While the tomatoes are breaking down, julienne another table spoon of ginger and chop some cilantro.
5. Add cumin, ground coriander, chili powder, garam masala, tumeric, black pepper, and MSG to mixture in the wok. The exact quantities of each are somewhat arbitrary, and I don't have a consistent system. Most combinations will turn out tasty, so feel free to experiment.
6. Reduce the sauce by cooking on high heat until the sauce is thick. Turn off the heat, and then add julienned ginger and chopped cilantro. Mix and serve with rice or naan.
