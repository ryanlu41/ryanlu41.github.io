#### Preface

These are some rough thoughts on suffering and healing that I put together for my Spirituality and Healing seminar. I am by no means an expert on this topic, but I thought adapting my oral presentatin into a blog post would be interesting.

#### What is Suffering? 

There is no single universal definition for what constitutes suffering, but it is generally acknowledged to be a very personal experience that goes beyond just physical and emotional pain. One common view is that suffering arises when something attacks one's sense of self and sense of meaning, and suffering is often expressed as part of one's life narrative. Eric Cassell, a physician and bioethicist, describes suffering as being "induced by the loss of integrity, intactness, cohesiveness, or wholeness of the person." Another writer describes it as a "crisis in meaning"; suffering occurs when personal narrative structures that previously maintained meaning in one's life are eroded by external forces, such as illnesses, changes in life circumstances, or losses. From a Buddhist perspective, the existence of *dukkha*, or suffering, is one of the Four Noble Truths. In the book *No Mud, No Lotus*, Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh uses an analogy of two arrows to describe suffering. When one is shot by a single arrow, there is a certain amount of pain. If one is then shot in the same exact spot by a second arrow, the pain is not just doubled--it is multiplied tenfold. Thich Nhat Hanh likens the first arrow to anything causing physical or emotional pain. The second arrow, which causes suffering, is our own reaction to these external events and is comprised of our fears, our anxieties, and our angers.

#### Overcoming Suffering

The simplest way to overcoming suffering is to remove the threat to one's integrity or sense of meaning; of course, this is often not possible. Thomas Egnew writes that even when the threat cannot be removed, healing and alleviation of suffering can occur through the *transcendence* of suffering. The use of the term *transcendence* reflects a fundamental change in the relationship between the self, the world, and the threat. Transcendence can be accomplished through finding meaning in suffering, through acceptance, and through hope.

Victor Frankl writes extensively about finding meaning through suffering in his book *Man’s Search for Meaning*. Frankl was an Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist who drew upon his experiences imprisoned in concentration camps during the Holocaust to develop logotherapy, a school of thought within psychotherapy that views life as a quest for meaning. For Frankl, all suffering has the potential for meaning: 

“If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.”

Frankl believes that meaning in suffering can come from suffering with courage. In his book, Frankl describes inmates who did not descend into savagery despite the dehumanizing and deplorable conditions of the camps. Instead, they suffered well by retaining their inner freedom, humanity, and dignity. To him, they were like martyrs. “They were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement.” Meaning in suffering can also come through sacrifice. One of Frankl’s patients lost his wife his wife during the Holocaust. He found meaning in his grief by viewing it as a necessary sacrifice that spared his wife the emotional suffering had she survived and he died.

Suffering can also be transcended through acceptance. In suffering, certain parts of one’s sense of self are under attack. But accepting that those parts are not necessary to one’s integrity and letting go of one’s attachment to them, one can transcend suffering and create new narrative structures to replace those that have been eroded away. These themes of unattachment and acceptance permeate Buddhist philosophy as well. I alluded to the first of the Four Noble Truths earlier; the full four are as follows:

1. *dukkha*: life is suffering
2. *samudaya*: the origin of suffering is *tanha*, or craving
3. *nirodha*: the cessation of *dukkha* comes with letting go of *tanha*
4. *marga*: the Eightfold Path can lead one to *nirodha*

In *No Mud, No Lotus*, Thich Nhat Hanh describes a number of strategies for alleviating suffering. The most essential strategy is letting go, and for this, he uses
