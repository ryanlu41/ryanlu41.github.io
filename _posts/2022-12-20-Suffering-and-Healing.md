Preface: These are some rough thoughts on suffering and healing that I put together for the final presentation of my Spirituality and Healing medical school seminar. I am by no means an expert on this topic, but I thought it would be interesting to adapt my oral presentation into a blog post. 

**What is Suffering?** 
There is no single universal definition for what constitutes suffering, but it is generally acknowledged to be a very personal experience that goes beyond just physical and emotional pain. One common view is that suffering arises when something attacks one's sense of self and sense of meaning, and suffering is often expressed as part of one's life narrative. Eric Cassell, a physician and bioethicist, describes suffering as being "induced by the loss of integrity, intactness, cohesiveness, or wholeness of the person." Another writer describes it as a "crisis in meaning"; suffering occurs when previously personal narrative structures that maintain meaning in one's life are eroded by an external force, such as illnesses, changes in life circumstances, or loss. From a Buddhist perspective, the existence of *dukkha*, or suffering, is one of the Four Noble Truths. In the book *No Mud, No Lotus*, Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh uses an analogy of two arrows to describe suffering. When one is shot by a single arrow, there is a certain amount of pain. If one is then shot in the same exact spot by a second arrow, the pain is not just doubled--it is multiplied tenfold. Thich Nhat Hanh likens the first arrow to any life event causing physical or emotional pain. The second arrow, which causes suffering, is our own reaction to these external events and is comprised of our fears, our anxieties, and our angers.
