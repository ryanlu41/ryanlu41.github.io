This recipe takes a while to make but is absolutely delicious. I have made it many times now, and it is perfect Asian comfort food during Chicago winters (ignore the fact that I'm posting this in the summer while in California). The recipe is based on [this recipe](https://tasty.co/recipe/taiwanese-beef-noodle-soup)

### Ingredients

* 2-3 lbs of beef chuck roast
* 6 scallions
* 8 slices of ginger
* 6 star anise pods
* 8 garlic
* 2 dried red chilies
* 1 onion
* 2 tomatoes
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 3 tbsp doubanjiang (spicy bean paste)
* cooking oil
* 1/2 cup rice wine
* 1/2 cup dark soy sauce
* 1/2 cup light soy sauce
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 dried bay leaf
* noodles
* bok choy


### Directions

1. Remove the bulbs from 6 scallions. Cut 8 slices of ginger, slice an onion, dice 8 clove of garlic, and cut 2 tomatoes into quarters.
2. Cut the chuck roast into 2-3 inch chunks. Add to a large pot with 3 scallions with their bulbs cut off, 5 slices of ginger, and 3 star anise pods. Fill the pot with water, bring to boil, and let boil for 5 minutes while using a spoon to scoop off the foam. Remove the meat and rinse in cold water. 
3. Stir fry 3 scallions, 3 ginger slices, the diced 8 garlic cloves, 2 dried red chilies, 3 star anise pods, 1 sliced onion, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 3 tablespoons doubanjian in a wok with vegetable oil over high heat until the onions become translucent. Add the chuck roast, 1/2 cup rice wine, 1/2 cup dark soy sauce, 1/2 cup light soy sauce, and tomatoes. Continue stir frying for 8 minutes. 
4. While stir frying, add 1 quart of water to a large pot and begin boiling. Once done stir frying, add the contents of the wok into the pot. If needed, add more warm water so that all the meat is covered. Add 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp salt, and 1 dried bay leaf. Let simmer for 3-5 hours. The longer you cook it, the more tender it will be! 
5. When ready to eat, boil water and cook the noodles. After the noodles are cooked, use the same warm water to cook the bok choy. Serve and enjoy.
