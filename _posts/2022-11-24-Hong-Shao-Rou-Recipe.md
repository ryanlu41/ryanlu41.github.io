This is a relatively easy recipe for making hong shao rou that I use pretty often. The source of the recipe is here: https://redhousespice.com/red-cooked-pork-belly/

### Ingredients

* 1.5 lbs pork belly
* 1 cup Shaoxing rice wine
* 2 tbsp light soy sauce
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 5 slices ginger
* 2 star anise
* 2 bay leaves
* 20 g rock sugar

### Directions

1. Cut pork belly into 1 inch pieces. Blanch by boiling in cold water and scooping out the foamy impurities with a spoon. Drain and rinse pork belly.
2. Put pork belly in a pot and add Shaoxing rice wine and enough hot water to cover the meat. Add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, ginger, star anise, and bay leaves. Simmer for 1.5 hours.
3. Add rock sugar. Turn heat to high, and boil until sauce reduces.
